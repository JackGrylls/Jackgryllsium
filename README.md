# Jackgryllsium
A repository for my custom Minecraft resource pack.
Generally speaking, it should include:
- Small, personal preferences tweaked
- Tweaking things for the sake of gameplay improvement (e.g. fire doesn't blind you)
- Some jokes/inside jokes, but not too intrusive
- The game should still feel more or less vanilla

## Feature List
- Tweaked armour
- Arrows on hoppers to indicate direction
- Tidier redstone dust
- Custom splashes
- Custom end credits
- Shorter fire
- Chiselled stone bricks has a centred texture
- Slightly edited clouds
- Slightly edited moon
- Different crosshair
- XP Bar and hotbar selection are aqua blue
- Pumpkin blur improved
- Some paintings replaced
- Transparent inventory background
- 3D Ladders

## Releases
- Latest (Lates Minecraft version)

If there is anything missing from a release that exists in the latest version of Jackgryllsium, please create an issue.
Obviously this does not include textures/models/etc for items that do not exist in older versions.
